# README for the LBM LoRaWAN Relay Project

## About

This project aims to implement the new LBM (LoRaWAN Backend Milestone) functionality for LoRaWAN, focusing on relay compatibility for end devices. By integrating this feature, end devices can now act as relays, enhancing network coverage and increasing LoRaWAN communication range without requiring hardware modifications or significant additional expenditures.

## Features

- **Relay Compatibility:** Enables LoRaWAN devices to function as relays, thereby improving network range and connectivity.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated into existing end devices with minimal configuration. Only tested on STM32L476 + SX1261.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implements the latest LoRaWAN security standards to ensure the protection of transmitted data.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Offers various configuration options to suit different application scenarios and deployment requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- LoRaWAN end device with compatible firmware (STM32L476 + SX1261). See the LoRa Alliance code for further end devices compatibilities.
- Development environment compatible with programming the end device (IDE/ C compiler).
- Basic knowledge of LoRaWAN and embedded programming.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/yourRepo.git
```

2. **Configure your device:**

Ensure your device is configured to accept the new LBM feature and is in development mode if necessary.

3. **Compile and upload:**

Open the cloned project in your IDE and compile the code. Then, upload the compiled firmware to your LoRaWAN end device.

### Configuration

- **Edit the configuration file:** Go to the configuration file (`config.h` or similar) to adjust the default settings according to your needs.
- **Activate the Relay Function:** Follow the specific instructions in the quick start guide provided to activate the relay function on your device.

## Usage

Once configured, the device will start functioning as a LoRaWAN relay, automatically retransmitting messages between end devices and the network. You can monitor relay activity and network performance through your LoRaWAN management console.
